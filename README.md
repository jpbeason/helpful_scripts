# Helpful Scripts
A collection of code excerpts that may come in handy during development.

## JSON data helper scripts  
* **prettyJSON.py**
  * Adds tabs to a unstylized JSON file to make it more human readable
  
* **createSampleJSON.py**
  * Creates a list of mockup JSON data, I often use this as a placeholder for the return of an API call if the required endpoint has yet to be solidified.
  
## misc
* **sign-combs.py**
  * A script that generates all possible outputs of a "combinations with replacement" problem, great for generating all possible option combinations a user may specify for an item in an e-commerce setting.
